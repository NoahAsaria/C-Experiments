# C# Experiments
This is my workspace for incrementally learning C# syntax and functionality by doing. As I learn more about the language and the .NET platform, I will be adding simple implementations to this repository. The end goal is to refine these approaches to follow and truly understand best practices for working with the language.

* Capabilities to implement *
- Authenticate and read from an API and download files. (KaggleAPIAccessor)

- Build data models to consume API requests and turn them into objects (KaggleAPIAccessor)

- Use LINQ to manipulate complicating data objects

- Connect the C# backend to a front end framework

- Process real-time data efficiently

- Process a variety of interesting file formats, including Blob, Graphs etc.
